# IMPACT OSS tasks
_Tracking global tasks and budget allocation_

An issue is created for each task for that funding is required or desired https://github.com/impactoss/impactoss-tasks/issues

Tasks can be labelled to represent progress and funding stages, as well as designate the type of task. You can see all labels here
https://github.com/impactoss/impactoss-tasks/labels

__The labels for the progress stages are__
1. `Idea`: all new tasks will be initially considered as an idea. These can be rough ideas without a detailed description
2. `Specification`: the task has been sufficiently specified so that providers can submit proposals. This may or may not include indications of expected budget and timeline
3. `Proposals`: at least one proposal incl estimated cost and indicative timelines has been submitted
4. `Accepted`: a proposal has been approved in principal but may not yet be (fully) funded
5. `In progress`: the provider has started working on the (approved) task
6. `Review`: the task has been marked as completed by the provider and is being reviewed 
7. `Approved`: a completed task has been approved
